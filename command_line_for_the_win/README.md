COMMAND LINE CHALLENGE PROJECT

This project, though not mandatory is fundamental to any SE and that's my reason of embarking on it. The project has introduced me to a new linux tool the sftp and linux screenshot tools.

HOW I DID THE TASK

For task 0 - I loged in to the sandbox environment in my local machine running linux. While in the sandbox environment I navigated to the alx-system_engineerng-devops git repository using the cd command. While in the mentioned repository I created a directory named command_line_for_the_win which I will regard as my project directory in subsequent mentions.

I navigated to my project directory within the sandbox environment and while there I created a README.md file to describe what the project was all about and how am able to tackle the tasks. After I created my README.md I visited this URL https://cmdchallenge.com (I will refer to this URL as CMD CAHLLENGE portal in subsequent mentions) using an internet browser. The website is an interactive platform where one can learn Unix OS command lines and it becomes more challenging the further you go. 

I solved for task one to nine in the CMD CHALLENGE portal. Since The requirement for task 0 is met I obtained the screenshot of the done task using spectacle screenshoot capture utility. After that I loged in to the sandbox environment the second time but with the sftp linux tool. I navigated to alx-system_engineering-devops and my project direcory. While in my project directory I used the sftp put command to upload the screenshoot obtained using spectacle that was stored in my local machine to the remote server.
